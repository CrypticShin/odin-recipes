    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>It couldn't be easier to make this sandwich with just bread, 
        eggs, butter, and Cheddar cheese. The simple breakfast comes 
        together in less than 10 minutes.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>2 slices of bread</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 slice Cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Place a Hobo Pie toaster in the hot coals of a campfire to heat for a few mins.</li>
            <li>Butter both slices of bread, then place one slice, butter-side down into the toaster.
                Crack the egg onto the bread, and break the yolk. Top with a slice of cheese and the 
                second slice of bread, butter-side up.
            </li>
            <li>Close the toaster and place into the coals of the fire. Cook for several minutes, 
                turning frequently, until the bread has browned nicely on both sides.
            </li>
        </ul>
